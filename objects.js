// 1. Create an object assigned to a variable called shirt.
// Give the object a property of color with a value of red
// Give a property of size with a value of large
// Give the object a method called getColor that returns the color of shirt.

// 2. Console.log the shirt's color.
// Console.log the output of the getColor.

// 3. Create an empty array assigned to a variable called wardrobe.
// This should contain all of your shirts.
// Create three new shirt objects with different colours and sizes
// Push the shirt objects to an array


// 4. (bit of a challenge!) Create a for loop that goes through the entire wardrobe array
// Each time it loops through, it should look at the shirt array item it is up to
// and console.log the colour of the shirt.
